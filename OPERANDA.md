# OPERANDA - Current State

Core TUI is functional with session, editors, tracer, variables, autocomplete, docs, command palette, focus mode, history paging, clear screen, save/load session.

## APL keycode support (BK/FD/SR style)

APLers expect standard keycodes like BK (Back), FD (Forward), SR (Redraw Screen). The Dyalog keycode table maps actions to keystrokes (see `$DYALOG/aplkeys/xterm`). We should support these as configurable aliases.

Terminal limitation: ctrl+shift+backspace and ctrl+shift+enter (BK/FD defaults) are not possible — backspace/enter are raw ASCII control chars that can't carry modifier info via escape sequences. We use ctrl+shift+up/down instead.

## Recent

- **FormatCode**: CLI `-fmt` flag for batch formatting APL files in place — works on both `.aplf` (functions) and `.apln` (namespaces/classes). TUI "format" command in command palette formats the focused editor/tracer. Uses RIDE `FormatCode`/`ReplyFormatCode` protocol messages. CLI opens a dummy editor window (function or namespace via `⎕FIX`) for the required window token. Multiline input (#5) is a prerequisite for creating namespaces interactively in the TUI.
- **Busy spinner**: Animated braille spinner in title bar (`gritt ⠋`) when interpreter is executing. Driven by `m.ready` / SetPromptType. Spinner tick via `tea.Tick` at 80ms. Also fixed Unicode width bug in `renderBox()` (`len(title)` → `len([]rune(title))`).
- **WaitForIdle**: New test helper in `uitest/runner.go` — checks for absence of all spinner braille frames. Replaced all `Sleep` calls after `SendLine` in `tui_test.go` with `WaitForIdle` (deterministic, ~3s faster).
- **Code review fixes**: Rune-safe truncation in `locals_pane.go`, HTTP status check in `aplcart.go`, mutex scope fix in `main.go`, tighter test assertions with negative checks.
